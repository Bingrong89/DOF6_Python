Requirements:
Python 3
OpenCV 4.1.1(There is a bug with SolvePnPRansac at OpenCV 3.4, any higher verions should be fine)
Numpy

The solution here is based on https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/d2c/tutorial_real_time_pose.html.
The original solution was written in C++, reimplemented here in Python with some modifications and simplifications.

I am also using the provided files from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/calib3d/real_time_pose_estimation/Data,
as I have found the performance to depend quite significantly on the mesh file provided.


Instructions for usage:
Run dof6.py from terminal,
python dof6.py --video --yml --ply
Paths can either be relative to the directory terminal is in, or absolute.

Or just run "python dof6.py" and use the default files provided in the folder.

While the video frames are running:
1 .press ESC to exit early
2. press s to pause or unpause
